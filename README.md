Python Twitter Bot
================

Nashville Ladies' Hack Day project to learn more about the Command Line Interface, Python, and the Twitter API. 

<br />

This Twitter bot was built for fun and to make people smile. The code searches Twitter for instances of "coding is hard," then automatic replies with a responses to encourage people in programming studies. The Twitter account and voice is from the viewpoint of my cat, Hampton, who loves to lay on my side (and sometimes all over my latop) when I am coding late at night.
